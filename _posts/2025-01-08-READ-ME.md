Choosing the right crayon to color a tree has always been tricky for me—I’m a dichromat, lacking sensitivity to red. When people hear this, they often ask how my world looks different from theirs, assuming my visual experience must be lacking. The truth is, I still marvel at autumn’s vibrant foliage and the sun’s transformation of the sky from blue to blazing orange.

The curiosity sparked by this personal experience led me to ask a fundamental question in vision science: How does the visual system construct such a rich and immersive perception of the world?
I began tackling this question during my undergraduate years at Yonsei University (Seoul, South Korea), working as a research assistant in the [Vision, Cognition and Consciousness Lab](https://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr) (Image 1) under Dr. Sang Chul Chong. In the same lab, I earned a master’s degree in psychology, where I investigated how the visual system efficiently processes the flood of incoming visual information despite biological and cognitive constraints using psychophysics methods.

In 2020 Summer, I moved to Ohio (GO BUCKS!) to pursue a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience at The Ohio State University (Ohio, USA) in the [OSU Vision & Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/) (Image 2). Under the supervision of Dr. Julie D. Golomb, I have been exploring the intersection between saccadic eye movements and visual perception, employing psychophysics, eye-tracking, and computational modeling of neuroimaging data (i.e., fMRI), with both low and high-level visual stimuli.

Upon graduating in 2025 Summer, I’m excited to begin a new chapter as a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Viola Stoermer’s lab at Dartmouth College. I’ll be continuing my research on the fascinating mysteries of human visual perception—and branching out into new areas as well! I welcome you to follow my work and please feel free to reach out or say hello if you see me at a future conference!
