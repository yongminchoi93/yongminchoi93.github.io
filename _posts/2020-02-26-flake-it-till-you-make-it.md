Choosing the right crayon to color a tree has always been tricky for me—I’m a dichromat, missing sensitivity to red. When people hear this, they often ask how my world looks different from theirs, assuming my visual experience must be lacking. The truth is, I still marvel at autumn’s vibrant foliage and the sun’s transformation of the sky from blue to blazing orange.

This blend of curiosity about perception and a personal connection to vision science led me to ask: How does the visual system create such a rich and immersive experience of the world?
I began tackling this question during my undergraduate years at Yonsei University (Seoul, South Korea), working as a research assistant in the [Vision, Cognition and Consciousness Lab](https://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr) (Image 1) under Dr. Sang Chul Chong. In the same lab, I earned a master’s degree in cognitive psychology, where I investigated how the visual system efficiently processes the flood of incoming visual information despite biological and cognitive constraints using psychophysics methods (Choi & Chong, 2020; Choi et al., 2024).

In 2020, I moved to Ohio to pursue a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience at The Ohio State University, supervised by Dr. Julie D. Golomb in the [OSU Vision & Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/) (Image 2). My research explores the interplay between saccadic eye movements and visual perception, employing psychophysics, eye-tracking, and computational modeling of neuroimaging data (i.e., fMRI), with both low and high-level visual stimuli.

I am now trying to open the next chapter of my academic journey as a postdoctoral researcher, continuing to explore the mysteries of human visual perception. Feel free to follow my work and don’t hesitate to say hello if you see me at a future conference!
