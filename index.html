## Educational/Academical background.
Choosing the right crayon for coloring the tree has always been a challenging task for me because I am a dichromat, lacking particular sensitivity to red. When people hear about my color deficiency, they often ask how the world I see is different from theirs. They assume that my visual experience is inferior and unsatisfying. However, I do experience the vibrant colors of autumn foliage, and the sun dyeing the blue sky into a blazing orange. 

My scientific career started the question of How does the visual system create rich and immersive visual experience? At Yonsei University (Seoul, South Korea), I was trained as undergraduate RA to experimentally examine mysteries underlying visual perception in [Vision, Cognition and Consciousness Lab](https://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr), supervised by Dr. Sang Chul Chong. In following years, I have completed my masters degree in cognitive psychology, actively investigating how the visual system process vast amount of visual information using limited biological and cognitive constraints (Choi & Chong, 2020; Choi et al., 2024).
In pursuit of my career as a vision scientist, I moved to Ohio in 2020 as a graduate student in the psychology department in the Ohio State University (cognitive neuroscience program), supervised by Dr. Julie D. Golomb in [OSU Vision & Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/). During my PhD program in Dr. Golombâ€™s lab, my research has broadly focused on the relationship between saccadic eye movement and visual perception, utilizing a range of techniques including psychophysics, eye-tracking, and fMRI, with both low and high-level visual stimuli.
